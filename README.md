Live Intentionally: Discipline, Mindset, Direction – 90-Day Personal Project

Introduction
Hello, thank you for purchasing this book. I assure you this will be one of the most
important purchases you'll ever make.
The objectives of this book are simple:
- Help you live intentionally
- Cultivate discipline, self-control and mental strength
- Strengthen your mindset, thought process, and help you
find direction in your life
We live in a world of mental weakness. People are slaves to their desires, emotions,
and fleeting distractions.
Modern men lack willpower and judgment, and pursue
short-term pleasure at great long-term cost.
They waste their time and potential on things that are scientifically designed to be
highly addictive and eye-catching: junk food, porn
on the Internet, TV shows, news, video games and social media – this time is taken
from time that should have been spent building
business, relationships, networks and other valuable assets.
As more people waste their lives, it will become easier for people who take their time
seriously to stand out - the competition is eliminating itself, and now a part

Live Intentionally: Discipline, Mindset, Direction – 90-Day Personal Project

The essence of the game is not to fall into the traps that everyone else is falling into.

This includes not only the mental garbage, which has been scientifically engineered
as mentioned above, but also the culture of apathy and lack of ambition – when
people's lives have no purpose or meaning, and they simply live day after day
without expecting anything.
nothing.

This book is dedicated to you:
– that you want more out of life than watching TV all day.
– that you want to regain control of your business mind,
merchants and addictive products.
– that you are willing to do the work necessary to make it a reality
your vision of the future instead of waiting and daydreaming.
– that you are willing to walk unconventional paths to
reach unconventional destinations.

Live Intentionally: Discipline, Mindset, Direction – 90-Day Personal Project

How This Book Works
This book consists of several projects and exercises that you must do to
achieve great physical and mental strength, stability, emotional control and selfunderstanding.
Some of them only need to be done once, while others
need to be done every day.
Just reading won't change anything in you.

You'll only see the benefits if you take action, but I can guarantee you one thing
- IF you take action, YOU WILL SEE the results.

I can show you the way, but I can't walk in your place.
Finally, I need you to trust me. Some of the exercises in this book won't make sense
to you at first. You might think something is "frivolous" or that it won't work.

I'm asking you to put that feeling aside for the next 90 days and do what this book
says. I've personally done everything written in this book many, many times, and
from my own experience, I know what works best.

Once you complete this 90-day project, you'll see the difference in yourself, your
mindset, and your life. And then you'll understand why this book asked you to do
what it says.

adapt them to your specific needs and situations.
Along with this book, you'll receive a workbook that will help you keep track of
everything you need to do.
I recommend that you print the workbook and leave it next to your
computer (or wherever you spend most of your time).
This way, you'll always be aware of the things you need to do.
Also, I recommend that you revisit this book once a week while you are working
on this personal project so that you don't forget.

It will only take you 90 days to implement this book, and it has the potential to

We waste our potential when we are idle and don't have a

While you can follow this book and get a lot out of it, even if you don't have a

you have a goal that you seek to achieve.
Your mission for these 90 days depends on you and your vision.

If you are having trouble assigning a goal yourself, select
any of the examples listed below:
• Lose X kg of weight – This would involve doing extra exercise and recording your
weight every morning.

• Establish a side business – The easiest side businesses are those that
can be run online, the simplest of which is creating niche affiliate
marketing websites that generate some passive income.

• Cover X% of the curriculum and aim for X average grade

Introspection: Who Are You?
Before we start doing anything else, we first need to know
who we are. You may feel like you already know who you are, but chances are
you're wrong. Much of your understanding of "you" is

When you go about your life, you probably meet people who praise
various aspects of your personality. You feel good when you receive that
praise, and your brain is programmed to chase that feeling.
You try to be more than what people praise in you and you try to eliminate parts
about you that other people don't like. You do this unconsciously, without

you to be better, or because they (consciously or unconsciously) want you to
be like them.

Exercise: Where Do My Desires Come From?
Many of the things we think we want are planted in our
headed by third parties – usually marketers and society.
Take a piece of paper and write down the things you want for yourself in the next
10 years. This can be anything from having a wife and children
to owning a sports car, running a business empire, having a
well-paid job, living with the Shaolin monks, taking revenge on someone who
has hurt you, all of them, and that list had better be long and well thought out for
the next 10 years.
Now, think about each of these goals with an open mind and
ask yourself:
• Do I want this or do other people want this from me?
• Do I want this or did some salesman on TV tell me I should?
want it?
• Do I want to own this, or do I just want to experience it? Does owning this make me feel

will it make me happy or will I be just as satisfied just by experiencing it?
You'll realize that many of your desires aren't your own. You'll also realize
that there are many things you don't really want long-term; you just want
them long enough to experience them.
Congratulations! You are already one step ahead of the average person –

Live Intentionally: Discipline, Mindset, Direction – 90-Day Personal Project

You've known what you want from yourself for a decade. Most people
either have no idea (live directionlessly) or are busy
chasing someone else's dreams.
You pick up "personality bits" from TV shows and try to emulate
whatever feels "cool" to you. This is especially true if you've seen
many comedy series as a teenager/young adult.
To undo this programming, it's crucial to understand your own life story. It's
very important to reflect on and study your past.
Where do you come from? What events shaped your life? How did you get
to where you are today?
What you need to do is simple (but a bit long): Write your own
autobiography.
Take a piece of paper and a pen and write your life story. Divide your life
into as many parts/chapters as you like: Childhood, High School, Adolescence,
High School, College, Work, Love, etc.
Write down everything you can remember and write it from your heart. Write
about the events that took place in your life and write about how you felt and
you still feel when you think of them. Try to imagine each story
playing it back in your mind like a movie.
Be honest with yourself and don't alter the details just because you don't
you want to accept reality.

I recommend completing this project over a period of one or two weeks. It should take
you approximately 12-20 hours to complete, or perhaps even longer depending on how
long you reflect on each event.
Don't rush and don't treat this as a goal-oriented activity you're trying to complete as
quickly as possible. Take your time.

and take breaks to reflect.

You don't have to show this book to anyone, nor do you have to publish it. The only thing
what you have to do is write it down.
As you write this, imagine your life playing out like a movie in
the background.

You will 'relive' many emotionally charged moments in your life, and you will feel new
and old emotions rising up within you .
When that happens, don't rush and don't be in a hurry to move on, no matter how bad or
uncomfortable you feel.
Take your time to process these emotions.
It's okay to feel emotional or even cry during this exercise.
As you progress with this exercise, you will notice that you feel much more
light, that you have finally accepted the past and have managed to move on.
Many people spend their entire lives waiting for a better past and, as a result, are unable
to enjoy their present and future.
You will also notice that this exercise will make you more stable.

Throw Out The Trash
If we wish to become masters of our lives and our destinies,
We must get rid of the things that seek to make us their slaves.
We must discard the unhealthy habits from our lives: the things we do that give us no
benefit, the things that take value away from our lives, the things that distract us from
our mission and divert us.
our attention to meaningless activities.
For the next 90 days, we will eliminate unhealthy habits and activities from our lives.
This means that, for the next 90 days, we will abstain from:

1. Social networks
2. Porn and masturbation
3. Cigarettes, alcohol and drugs
4. Watch TV, movies and play video games
5. Read clickbait pop culture articles and watch the news.
The problem with all these activities is that they give you a quick hit of
dopamine without you having to use any effort to earn that
placer.
They take up a lot of your time and give you nothing of value in return.
They destroy your attention span and weaken your brain.

Porn and Masturbation
Porn is an addiction. It cuts our brain's connections from the
same way drugs do.

between a real human and a video of a naked woman on a screen.
Porn provides an orgasm without all the other chemicals and intimacy involved
in sex with a real person. As a result, it's "empty" and highly addictive.

Most people who watch porn are porn addicts who can't go a week without
having to look. Furthermore, because of the associated social stigma, most
are never able to talk openly about it or seek help. (Many aren't even aware
they're addicted.)

Studies have shown that watching porn damages1 and shrinks your brain.2

Berlin found that men who watch a lot of porn tend to have a smaller striatum, an
area of the brain "linked to rewards and motivation."

The study also found that the connection between the striatum and the
prefrontal cortex – the part of the brain associated with behavior
and decision-making – degraded with increased visualization
of porn.

Keep in mind that porn, for our 90-day abstinence, doesn't just include videos of
naked people, it also includes anything you look at erotically, even if it's pictures of
your friend on your
phone.

For the next 90 days, you will not watch porn and you will not masturbate.

If you need someone to talk to…
Cutting out porn and masturbation (especially if you're a man) is going to be very
difficult. Harder than you think.
It's very easy to fall back into porn and masturbation, not only because you're
horny, but also because you're bored.
Both are very hard to give up because your brain is programmed to want them and
because they are easily, privately, and freely available.
If you're feeling overwhelmed, I recommend checking out something called "nofap"
- it's an online community focused on abstinence from porn and masturbation.

when the impulses are in their

Your brain gets used to seeing something new and exciting every 5 seconds.
This is how social media destroys your attention span.

Social Media Hurts Your Momentum
Self-improvement requires a certain amount of isolation from social obligations. It's
hard to improve when you're constantly going out and 'for
relax'.
Let's say you spend a week working on yourself: you're exercising, reading,
avoiding junk food, etc. And then you log on to Facebook and see that your friend
Susan has been touring Europe, drinking and having a great time.

You feel jealous and wonder why you work so hard. You feel that
you deserve to have fun too.

You lose motivation and momentum.

Once you become addicted to social media (you probably already are), you'll notice
that you're no longer able to read books, especially books with small text and long
paragraphs. You feel distracted every few seconds, and you simply can't concentrate
for more than 5-10 minutes.
This is definitely not good news for your brain, so you're going to

to recover.
You will not use social media for the next 90 days, except

You'll always be "too busy" if you waste most of your day watching entertainment

Things Will Get Harder Before They Get Easier
Many of the behaviors mentioned above are habits you've probably been building for
years, if not decades.
They won't be easy to break.
You will find that your drive to enjoy them will increase during the
first two weeks before they begin to slowly taper off.
You will have to really resist the urges during that time,
while they try to eat you. You will hear your inner voice trying to
convince you to go back to your old ways.
"It doesn't matter".

"You're going to fail at some point anyway."
"Just 5 minutes."
"This doesn't really count."
Hang in there. YOU CAN DO IT.

Remember, everything you do is in your hands, and you can choose to ignore the
voice inside your head that is telling you to
break. No one can force you to do anything.
When ex-addicts say "the first two weeks are the hardest," they're not kidding. You'll

Breaking these bad habits isn't easy. It will be one of the hardest things
you'll ever do.

Meditation
If you live in the modern, fast-paced world, you must meditate.

There are millions of marketers and companies competing wildly with each
other for your attention, and believe it or not - they keep getting better. Ads
get better targeted, junk food gets tastier, and
posters become more eye-catching.

While this is ideal for your results, it adds "noise" to your life, and as a result,
people are becoming increasingly distracted and unaware.
Meditation will help us recover our brain from a noisy world and allow us to
live intentionally.
The benefits of meditation include:
• Greater ability to manage your emotions.
• Improved mood and happiness, stress levels
lower.
• Improved alertness and focus (regain your ability to
attention).
• Greater state of consciousness and attention.

• Helps you overcome addictions and makes urges easier
to handle.

• Strengthens your brain (improves your mental stability, memory and
control over the senses).
• Many other benefits such as deeper sleep, improved blood pressure,
improved organ health, lower risk of heart disease, improved hormone
levels, etc.
There is literally no reason for anyone not to meditate, other than laziness
and procrastination.
In order to incorporate meditation into our daily routine, we will meditate for 15
minutes a day for the next 90 days.
Meditation is easy (it's the art of doing nothing), and you don't need anything
special to do it. You don't need to buy fancy yoga pants,
a special mat or any product.

breathing and the sensation of your body rising and falling as you breathe
in and out, and let your thoughts come and go on their own.

attention to your breathing and continue normally. Don't blame yourself for
that.

you feel.

I remind you again that you won't be completely focused from day one. But you'll
get better as you practice every day.
People don't fail at meditating because it's difficult; they fail because they keep
putting it off and never finish doing it. Then meditation becomes something they
only did once.

Think about it this way: If your close friend gets into serious trouble, and you're
trying to help him, how would you talk to him?
Would you talk to him constructively and encourage him to think of solutions instead of
nagging him, or would you tell him he's an idiot for making a mistake and that his life is over?

If you are a good friend you will do the first thing.
But do you do the same for yourself?

When you make a mistake, do you think constructively and encourage yourself to learn
from it? Or do you call yourself an idiot for making that mistake?
Why don't you extend to yourself the same courtesy that you would extend to a
friend?
A lot of it comes down to society, because that's where we first take the tone of our internal

Society, in general, tends to be negative, dramatic, and overly critical.
We develop our "mental programming" by observing other people, even though they

However, taking control of that internal dialogue requires a LOT of
conscious effort and practice. (So, if you start to fail, don't get discouraged.
This is a very difficult task, and you're not expected to master it in 90

No Gossip
For the next 90 days, there will be absolutely no gossip.

Be intentional about your life. When you gossip about other people, you lose the

When you gossip, your life becomes about them.

or celebrities. All of these people are not living their own lives.
They are trying to live through other people.

Conquer Your Body
It is impossible to conquer your mind without conquering your body. You cannot have
a strong mind in a weak body.
Even Buddha had to learn to conquer hunger and control his bodily desires before
he could sit under a tree and meditate for seven weeks straight to achieve
enlightenment.
Although we won't learn to conquer hunger or meditate for weeks at a time, we will
try to make our bodies stronger and more flexible by giving them 1 to 1.5 hours of
exercise every day.
I'm not going to get into the "benefits of exercise" stuff, because you already know that.

You are aware of how vital exercise is for both your body and
your mind and I don't want to make this book too long with redundant information.

That being said, we're going to follow an exercise routine for the next 90 days, mainly
for two reasons you probably don't know:
1. When you exercise, your body releases a lot of dopamine, serotonin, and
endorphins (the release of these chemicals is what makes you "feel good"). When
you eliminate a lot of pleasurable activities (like porn and TV) from your life, your
body will start to crave the release of these chemicals.

Exercise will help you manage those cravings by acting as a substitute activity
for the release of these "fun" chemicals.

in your brain.
2. Exercise improves your ability to control your emotions by enhancing the connection
between your mind and your body. You'll be able to control your blood flow at will and
learn to manage your heart rate—both essential for emotional control.

Plus, as your hormones begin to balance out, you'll find it much easier to control random
emotional outbursts – and as
As a result, you will become a much calmer person.

As a bonus, exercise will give you an outlet to release any frustration and extra unused

This is one of the best books I've found on the topic of nutrition. It's comprehensive and
dispels many myths people have about nutrition and their bodies.

It also contains great information about epigenetics, beauty, and evolution - which I found
very interesting.

Also, if you're overweight, you're in luck, because I also decided to include a fat loss
program in this book. I couldn't write this book without including this fat loss guide because

Guide to Losing Fat
Keep in mind that everything in this chapter adds to everything in the chapter
anterior.

1. Skip Breakfast
If you want to lose weight, you have to create a caloric deficit.
Calorie deficit = Calories consumed – calories burned
You gain weight when the calories you consume are higher than the calories
you burn. (Of course, there are more, but this equation is a very good
generalization.)
By skipping breakfast, you end up eating fewer calories per day, and that will
help you lose a lot of fat over time.
Isn't breakfast the most important meal of the day?
No, it isn't. The slogan "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day"
was coined in the 19th century by James Caleb Jackson and John Harvey
Kellogg to sell their newly invented breakfast cereal.
Also, this is not a permanent lifestyle change - you can
come back for breakfast if that's what you want to do after

of having lost

all the extra pounds of fat around your body. No
you need to stay in a state of caloric deficit forever.

2. Focus on protein:
Not only will we reduce sugars and vegetable oil, but we'll also focus on eating protein-rich
foods. It's not a list .

exhaustive:
• Eggs

• Meat
• Legumes
• Cottage cheese and other dairy products
Ideally, you should eat ~2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
Not only will this improve your health, but you won't feel as hungry because the
protein will be highly satiating.
You can eat an absurdly large amount of carbs before you feel full (and feel hungry
again in a short period of time), but eating protein will make you feel full much faster
(and for much longer).

3. Eat at the same time every day:
Your body has its own biological clock. If you eat at a certain time, it will learn to feel
hungry at that time.
When you start implementing this guide, you'll feel hungry at the time you normally
eat breakfast. But in two weeks, that won't happen.

5. There are no days off:
The dumbest mistake you can make when you're overweight and trying to lose
weight is taking days off.
When you're overweight, and you've been on a diet for a week, and you have an "off
day," you won't be making any progress... at all.
Let's say you create a 500 calorie deficit per day (great), so over 6 days, you saved
3,000 calories.
But then you decide to have a day off and you eat a large pizza, drink some coke,
and have some dessert; you've already eaten 3,000 calories.
extra on that day.
The overall progress you made that week: almost nothing.
You can only have days off when you are in shape.
Only fit people "deserve" days off.
If you're fat, it's because your whole life has been one giant day off.
If you really want to lose that weight once and for all, no more cheating.
And that's it. That's all you need to do to lose fat.
If you follow everything in this guide, you can expect to lose 0.5-1 kg of fat per week
for the first 3-6 months, half of that for the next 3-6 months, and then taper off. Of

In general, the heavier you are, the more weight you'll lose per week. As you get
fitter, the fat loss numbers will get smaller.

By following this diet guide and exercising, you'll lose weight. There are no
"secrets" or "special tricks" to doing it.
Just diet and exercise.
(You keep hearing about special secrets because secrets sell and people want
shortcuts, but when it comes to biology, the shortcut ends up being the long way
around. Don't waste your money on any special weight-loss products; just follow
this chapter consistently and you'll be fine.)

PS Make sure to measure your weight every week to keep track
of the overall trajectory of your progress.

For the first two days, you do very well.
Then, for the next two days, you do it, but not very well.

And then it becomes something you once did.
Then, a few weeks or months later, the motivation to do it
returns.
