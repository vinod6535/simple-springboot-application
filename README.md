If you're feeling overwhelmed, I recommend checking out something called "nofap" 
- it's an online community focused on abstinence from porn and masturbation.
Both are very hard to give up because your brain is programmed to want them and 
because they are easily, privately, and freely available.
It has a lot of men motivating and supporting each other in difficult times, especially 
when the impulses are in their
peak and your mind is really trying to convince you to break up.
Cutting out porn and masturbation (especially if you're a man) is going to be very 
difficult. Harder than you think.
It's very easy to fall back into porn and masturbation, not only because you're 
horny, but also because you're bored.

Not only will this improve your health, but you won't feel as hungry because the

You can eat an absurdly large amount of carbs before you feel full (and feel hungry
